# My VSCode Setup

This repository contains my personal configuration for the awesome and extensible Visual Studio Code editor. Here, I keep an updated list of extensions I find useful for my workflow. In addition, I also keep my preferred editor settings as well as any required extension-based settings.

All these extensions can be installed at once by running [install-extensions.sh](./scripts/install-extensions.sh) from a terminal window.  


## Editor Settings

My current editor settings are saved in [settings.json](./settings/settings.json). Personally, I like to disable the mini map and cursor blinking, and enable things like file auto save after some delay. Some settings may not be ideal for some type of projects, but the good thing is that they can be overwritten when working with workspaces.  


## SFTP Settings

The SFTP extension requires you to specify some settings. [sftp.json](./settings/sftp.json) contains the general structure I follow to configure the extension and [sftp-sample-configuration.json](./settings/sftp-sample-configuration.json) is a complete configuration file. The extension's official documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/liximomo/vscode-sftp).  


## Workspaces

In the workspaces directory, there are some workspace files with custom settings which I use in my workflow.
